# Installing components for GUI

Make sure pip is on your computer even if you are using Windows, you can run it from the cmd app if you choose "run as administrator."

## Get SIP

Installation instructions: https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/sip/download

Type:
pip3 install SIP

## Get PyQt5

Instructions: https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5

It has to be version 5, because it is not backwards compatible.

Type:
pip3 install PyQt5

## Get Qt (Optional?)

Download site: https://www.qt.io/

This is needed to make changes to the UI, and probably also to run the code. Go to the downloads section and make sure to download the Open Source version, not the Free Trial of Commercial version!

## Get Qt Designer (NOT Creator)
