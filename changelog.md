## Overall Changes
[A link to a video documenting our progress.](https://youtu.be/B-Ed5MmvXd0)
We have configured a series of micro:bits to act as radio receivers and transmitters in order to allow our users to have more precise data collection methods
without letting wires get in the way. We also forwarded the data received into Wekinator for use in further analysis.
The data provided by these recivers will allow our system to tell the user exactly what they can change to produce a better
freethrow, golf swing, or any other sports movement. 

## Individual
Michael, Jon, Jon, Christoph: Configured the radio transmitters and receivers of the micro:bits for use in the system. Hooked up the received data
to Wekinator. 

Stacia: Continued research into varying motion capture techniques.

## Continuing Work
* Transition from Wekinator to a more robust backend system
* Begin UI interface

## Overall Changes
We have accomplished a very basic MVP showcasing how the kinect can be used to capture motion in 3D space. This includes processing code
for both sending kinect data to wekinator, and having an output showing how 'close' you are to the desired motion.

## Individual
Michael, Jon, Jon, Christoph: Worked on getting the kinect to caputure motion, send to wekinator, and improve the kinect's capabilities. Did extensive
testing on the best type of environments and backgrounds for the system to work in. Discussed how we intend to structure the user 
interface. Also worked on constructing physical backdrop. 

Stacia: Underwent research into different motion capture techniques, including multiple camera 3d motion capture. 

## Continuing Work
* Transition from Wekinator to a more robust backend system
* Begin UI interface
