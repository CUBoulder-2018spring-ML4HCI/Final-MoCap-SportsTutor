## Overall Changes
We have accomplished a very basic MVP showcasing how the kinect can be used to capture motion in 3D space. This includes processing code
for both sending kinect data to wekinator, and having an output showing how 'close' you are to the desired motion.

## Individual
Michael, Jon, Jon Christoph: Worked on getting the kinect to caputure motion, send to wekinator, and improve the kinect's cabalities

Stacia: Underwent research into different motion capture techniques, including multiple camera 3d motion capture.
