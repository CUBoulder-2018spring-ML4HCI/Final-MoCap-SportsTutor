## Overall Changes
We have accomplished a very basic MVP showcasing how the kinect can be used to capture motion in 3D space. This includes processing code
for both sending kinect data to wekinator, and having an output showing how 'close' you are to the desired motion.

## Individual
Michael, Jon, Jon Christoph: Worked on getting the kinect to caputure motion, send to wekinator, and improve the kinect's capabilities. Did extensive
testing on the best type of environments and backgrounds for the system to work in. Discussed how we intend to structure the user 
interface. Also worked on constructing physical backdrop. 

Stacia: Underwent research into different motion capture techniques, including multiple camera 3d motion capture. 

## Continuing Work
* Transition from Wekinator to a more robust backend system
* Begin UI interface
